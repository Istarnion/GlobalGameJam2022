Global Game Jam 2022
====================

Made at the Spillmakerlauget Midt site in Norway, with TypeScript.

# Team Members
TBA

# Assets
All assets in the `res` folder are either placeholders created in advance of the jam, or created
during the jam.

An exception to this are the pixel font assets used. These are made by Chevy Ray Johnston and can
be purchased from this URL: http://pixel-fonts.com/
In order to run the game, create a folder called `licenced_res` next to the `res` folder. Within,
create a folder called `express_mono` where you place the `metrics.txt` and `atlas32.png` files, found
in the `Assets/pixel-fonts/Assets/ChevyRay - Express Mono` folder in the asset pack.
If you are a game developer, I highly recommend buying the entire pack and sending Chevy a little
extra on top - the fonts are truly great!
